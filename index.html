  <p class="desc">Sustainability is a topic that's been on everbody's mind lately. Sustainable fashion, especially. This is because clothing production uses a lot of energy and creates a lot of pollution as a result, and that's just scratching the surface of how damaging fast fashion can be. </p>
  <p class="desc">So, what can we do about it? Luckily, that's where FashionForward comes in. Here at FashionForward, we provide information about the fast fashion industry, options for you to donate your clothes, overview of the sustainability ratings of different brands, and more! Hopefully, we can all work together to stop fast fashion at its source. </p>
